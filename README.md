Data Structures and Algorithms (Pavankumar Hegde)

## What is Java?

Java Programming is a high-level programming language created by sun microsystems. This programming language is reliable, object-oriented and secure. Java follows the WORA principle, which stands for “Write Once Run Anywhere”. You can run a java program as many times as you want on a java supported platform after it is compiled.
